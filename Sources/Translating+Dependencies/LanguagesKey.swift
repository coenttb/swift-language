    ///

    /// // Limit translations to specific languages
    /// withDependencies {
    ///     $0.languages = [.english, .dutch, .french]
    /// } operation: {
    ///     let translated = Translated { language in
    ///         // Only called for English, Dutch, and French
    ///         lookupTranslation(for: language)
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Note: Defaults to all available languages in production
